D-ACO/GA - A bio-inspired strategy for feature selection in anomaly traffic detection in smart IoT environments.

## :memo: Abstract
With the growth of *IoT* and its acceptance in the technological environment, a discussion to be raised is the invasions of these devices, making it necessary to implement new controls to ensure information security. This growth is accompanied by a significant increase in cyber threats, as well as delays in detection. Consequently, the use of artificial intelligence techniques, especially machine learning and bio-inspired algorithms, such as *ACO* and *GA*, becomes essential to improve IoT security by identifying anomalies. This research proposes a feature selection strategy, called *D-ACO/GA*, for *IoT* environments. The proposed approach uses *ACO* and *GA* with supervised machine learning classification techniques. Thus, \acrshort{ACO} and \acrshort{GA} are applied in the selection of data subsets, aiming to identify the best features for anomaly detection. Through this strategy, we achieved an average accuracy of 99.26\% for *ACO*, and 98.80\% for *GA* with the *N-BaIoT* dataset.
